### Project Title : E-Recycle


### Problem Statement/Opportunity : 
Environmental problems have attracted attention all over the world. People are becoming increasingly conscious of a variety of problems like global warming, air, water, and land pollution. Human activities create waste, and it is the way this waste is handled, stored, collected, and disposed of which can pose risks to the environment and public health. Waste disposal is an immediate and critical issue for the community now and ineffective or irresponsible disposal of solid waste pollutes the environment and poses a health risk to the public. Waste management technologies like landfilling and incineration are not a complete solution to this problem. No one wants a waste management site in his or her neighborhood. Thus Guiding people on waste management techniques
and types of waste and about how to manage their waste could be a great initiative toward saving our Ecosystem hence saving the earth.

Azure made smart bot which answers all queries of user related to waste management with help of Azure Q-n-A maker service and knowledge Base.
